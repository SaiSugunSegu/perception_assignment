# Stereo Camera Calibration

- In this exercise, we have a Horizontal Stereo Normal camera, and we will calibrate and understand the Intrinsics of each camera and rectify the Images.
- We will then apply Stereo Rectification to create a Disparity Map.
  - Intrinsics Parameter Estimation and Image Rectification.
  - Imaging matching and finding correspondence.
  - Baseline estimation using Essential Matrix decomposition.
  - Disparity calculation for Depth Map.


## Intrincics Calibration 

### Step 1: Understanding Pinhole Camera Model and Distortion Model.

The pinhole camera model is a simple representation of how light creates an inverted image on a surface through a small hole. It doesn't require a lens, forms inverted images, has a large depth of field, and longer exposures. It's a basic concept in imaging despite its limitations.

- **Camera Model** - Pinhole Model - Camera Parameters are `fx`, `fy` (focal length) and `cx`, `cy` (principal points), and `s` (scale in analog cameras).
- **Distortion Model** - Deviations can arise due to imperfections in camera lenses or the camera's sensor.

- There are two kinds of distortion models:
- **Brown-Conrady (Radial-Tangen)**: k1, k2, p1, p2, p3
  - Barrel distortion
  - Pincushion Distortion
- **Kannala-Brandt**: k1, k2, k3, k4.
  - for wide angle, fish eye lens.

  

### Step 2: Using DLT (Zhang's method) and estimate 
  - We can use Direct Linear Transform to estimate pixel (2D) to checker points (3D) mapping.
  - In this exercise, we will use the OpenCV function to estimate the camera parameters and Distortion parameters by minimizing the reprojection error.

### Step 3: Calibration Using Opencv and Charuco markers.
- We use the Charuco board to collect corners and IDs, I personally prefer April Tags to make detection robust detection in rotation.

- Use the parameters to rectify (undistort) the image.
  - See the barreled board became straight after rectification.

### Step 4: Validate the Intrinsics using Reprojection Error
- Opencv inherently minimizes re-projection error by projecting the pixel back using transformation estimate vs. target pixels (charuko config).
- **Re-Projection Error of less than 1 pixel is considered good calibration, we got 0.3 pixels**

## Stereo Rectification 

### Step 1: Image Matching
- We should use Good Feature Detectors and Feature Descriptors for detection and decription.
- SIFT - Scale Invariant Feature Transform
- SURF - Speeded Up Robust Feature
- ORB - Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief.

  - These are good enough detector and descriptor, we get key points from this. if we get the less correspondences, we can use the charuco cornors as keypoints.

- We use simple Hamming distance to do nearest neihourhood search.

### Step 2: Baseline (R and T) from Essential Matrix.
- We know the intrincics, so, we can estimate Essential Matrix and decompose it with SVD(singular value decomposition) and find R and t between cam1 to cam2.
- We need to estimate b (baseline) to find disparity.

  
### Step 3: Disparity Map and Depth Map Using Triangulation.
