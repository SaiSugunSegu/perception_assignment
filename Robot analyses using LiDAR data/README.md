# Robot analyses using LiDAR data
This Exercise is to Analyze the Data using various tool

  1. [Foxglove-studio](https://foxglove.dev/)
  2. [Plot Juggle](https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler)
  3. [rosbag2_py](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2)
  4. [Open3d](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D)

I have been using these tool for long time, and i have used all these to analyse the data.

Short Intro on these tools that help in data analysis
Certainly, here's a slightly more detailed introduction:

- **Foxglove Studio:**
Foxglove Studio is a comprehensive robotics tool tailored for visualization and analysis. It offers an intuitive interface to visualize data streams from various sources such as sensors and robots in real time. Its playback, debugging, and customization features empower developers to gain insights into the behavior of their robotic systems efficiently.

- **PlotJuggler:**
PlotJuggler is a specialized open-source tool for visualizing time series data. Often utilized in robotics, it excels at displaying data from diverse sensors and devices in a synchronized manner. By aiding in the identification of trends, patterns, and irregularities within data, PlotJuggler becomes an invaluable asset for understanding and optimizing the performance of robotic systems.

- **Open3D:**
Open3D is an open-source library catering to 3D data processing and visualization needs. It finds its application in robotics and computer vision projects, offering functionalities like point cloud manipulation, mesh generation, and 3D scene reconstruction. This library empowers developers to work with complex 3D data structures, making it indispensable in tasks involving 3D sensing and visualization.

- **rosbag2_py:**
In the realm of robotics, ROS is prominent. The `rosbag2_py` library is a Python toolset designed for ROS 2's bag files, which store various messages and data collected during robot operations. It enables developers to programmatically read, write, and manipulate ROS 2 bag files, thus facilitating data extraction, transformation, and analysis for improved testing and system understanding.
